# TODO

- generate a hex-grid coordinate system
- assign stars to one of the coordinates; remove that coordinate from the "emptyCoords" array and add to "occupiedCoords" array
- create a tick-based turn system
- generate ships movement on tick
- generate new ships on tick
- implement star types with different ship generation rates
- create a tick-rate adjustment option
- create a save/load game function (at least for map to begin with)
- implement drag-and-drop star placement for map creation
- allow to save permanent maps
- implement drag-vector ship movement between stars
- implement multiple player identities and zone-of-control background colors
- implement attack dynamics between stars of opposing players
