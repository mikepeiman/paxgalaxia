# Star Battle

## An homage to the little-known game Pax Galaxia, RIP ~ 2011?

The game was extremely simple yet rich in strategy and replay value. Development ceased sometime .. I forget. Maybe 2009? Give or take a couple of years.

I hope to create something the captures the same addictive gameplay, depth of strategy, and simplicity, with what I'd consider richer graphics and a better multiplayer ecosystem.
